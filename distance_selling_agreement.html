      <h1>Distance Selling Agreement</h1>
      <p>Last update 12 - 03 - 2020</p>
      <h2>1. PARTIES OF THE CONTRACT</h2>
      <p>This Distance Selling Agreement is executed by and between PranaGEO Ltd.Şti. (“PranaGEO” “We” “Our”) and the customer (“Buyer” “Customer” “Member” “You”) logged into the Website and/or the Member customer at the time of approval by the Member in the electronic environment with respect to the utilization of the Website. The Member agrees and declares that she/he has already read the Membership Agreement and Distance Selling Agreement entirely and understand the content of the Agreement completely and approve all the provisions of the same through login to the Website and/or become a Member.</p>
      <p>In order to make purchases on the Site, you will be required to provide your personal details. In particular, you must provide your real name, phone number, e-mail address and other requested information as indicated. Furthermore, you will be required to provide payment details that you represent and warrant are both valid and correct and you confirm that you are the person referred to in the Billing information provided. Products purchased by the Buyer are for personal or gift use and should not be re-sold, used for commercial purposes or any other commercial benefit.</p>
      <h2>2. SUBJECT OF THE CONTRACT</h2>
      <p>The subject of this Contract is to determine the mutual rights and obligations of the Parties hereto as per the provisions of the Act 6502 on the Protection of the Consumers and the Regulation on Distance Sales Contracts as well as all other applicable regulations and applications related to the sales/ purchase and delivery of the product(s) with the below stated properties and the sales price ordered by the Buyer via the electronic environment via the website <a href="http://www.melda.io">www.melda.io</a> (hereinafter “the Website” or the Site”) of the Seller. </p>
      <h2>3. PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO THE CONTRACT</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Orders:</h3>
      <p>All orders are subject to acceptance and availability, and items in your shopping basket are not reserved and may be purchased by other customers.</p>
      <p>PranaGEO offers products for sale that are in stock and available for dispatch from our distribution center. Occasionally, however, we may be waiting for shipments from our suppliers..</p>
      <h3>3.2. Acceptance of Payment:</h3>
      <p>Once the Buyer has made his/her choice and his/her order has been placed, the Buyer will receive an email acknowledging the details of his/her order. This email is NOT an acceptance of your order, just a confirmation that the order has received it.</p>
      <p>Unless Buyer cancels his/her order, acceptance of his/her order and completion of the contract between Buyer and PranaGEO will be completed when PranaGEO emails the Buyer to confirm the goods have been dispatched. The sale contract is therefore concluded in Istanbul, Turkey and the language of the contract is English or/and Turkish. Neither our third party payment processor nor our nominated courier has the authority to accept an order on behalf of THE PranaGEO.</p>
      <p>PranaGEO reserves the right not to accept his/her order in the event, for example, that we are unable to obtain authorization for payment, that shipping restrictions apply to a particular item, that the item ordered is out of stock or does not satisfy our quality control standards and is withdrawn, or that the Buyer does not meet the eligibility criteria set out within this Agreement.</p>
      <p>Whilst every effort is made to make sure details on our website are accurate, we may from time to time discover an error in the pricing of products. If we discover an error in the pricing of a product in your order, we will let you know as soon as possible. We shall be under no obligation to accept or fulfill an order for a product that was advertised at an incorrect price and reserve the right to cancel such an order that has been accepted or is in transit. If you order a product that is priced incorrectly for any reason, we will inform you that we have not accepted your order and/or that the relevant part of your order has been cancelled. If you have already paid for the goods, we shall refund the full amount as soon as we are able. In the event that products are recalled in transit, we will process your refund once the products have been returned to us.</p>
      <h3>3.3. Pricing Policy:</h3>
      <p>Product prices are set when items are added to the online shop and set according to existing currency exchange rates. Buyers purchasing from a country served as Incoterms 2010 DDP will incur relevant import duty and tax. These costs are included in the final purchase price. Buyers purchasing from a country served as Incoterms 2010 DDU will be charged for the items purchased and shipping costs only. Import duty or tax costs will be invoiced to you directly from TNT.</p>
      <h3>3.4. Payment Type:</h3>
      <p>PranaGEO accepts Visa and MasterCard. The Buyer can also choose to pay with PayPal. When selecting this option at checkout, the Buyer will be directed to the PayPal site to ‘Log In’ and review the amount shown before clicking ‘Pay Now’. Once this transaction is complete, you will then return to <a href="http://www.melda.io">www.melda.io</a>. Payment will be debited and cleared from your account upon dispatch of your order by PranaGEO. The Buyer confirms that the credit/debit card that is being used is his/her or that Buyer has been specifically authorized by the owner of the credit/debit card to use it. All credit/debit cardholders are subject to validation checks and authorization by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorize payment to PranaGEO, THE PranaGEO will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery. To help ensure that your shopping experience is safe, simple, and secure, PranaGEO uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Furthermore, we take reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorized access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from the Site. </p>
      <h3>3.5. Insurance and Delivery:</h3>
      <p>The type, quantity, model, color, sales price, and delivery information of the Product is as provided by the client on the web site. The software licenses will be downloaded automatically after successful payment and will not be shipped. The other product(s) will be delivered to the address of the Buyer stated above. Even if the Buyer will not be present at the delivery time, the Seller will be deemed as it has performed its obligations hereunder fully and completely. Therefore, any and all losses and damages due to the late receipt of the Product by the Buyer, delay delivery to the cargo company and/ or the return of the Product to the Seller shall be incurred solely by the Buyer.</p>
      <p>Cargo Fee: is calculated according to Buyers given an address, shall be added to the order price and paid by the client. Cargo Fee is not included in the price of the product. Please note that we aim to dispatch all orders within minimum 48 hours. In any event, we will deliver the goods to you within 30 days of the day on which we accept your order. PranaGEO is not responsible for any delays caused by destination customs clearance processes. If delivery is delayed by any event outside of our control, we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimize the effect of the delay.</p>
