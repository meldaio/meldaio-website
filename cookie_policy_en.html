    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Last update: 15 - 10 - 2018</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Cookie Policy is an addendum to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of PranaGEO Ltd Şti. Any definitions used in those Policies will have the same meaning in this Policy. This Policy outlines how PranaGEO uses Cookies and other tracking technologies to run and deliver the service, and how you can choose which type of tracking to disable. If you would like to get in touch about anything in this policy or about your personal data then please contact us at <a href="mailto:connect@pranageo.com">connect@pranageo.com</a>. </p>
    <h3>1. What is a cookie?</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a small text file with an identifier sent by us to your computer or mobile device, and stored in your browser. “Session-based” cookies last only while your browser is open and are then deleted. “Persistent” cookies last until you or your browser deletes them, or they expire. Cookies do not typically contain any personally identifiable information, but may be linked to personal information we store about you. For example, if you are logged in with a registered user, the cookie will help us remember that you are logged in when you return to the site. <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/">To find out more about cookies, see this link</a>. </p>
    <h3>2. What is local storage?</h3>
    <p>Local storage is a component of the Web storage application programming interface. It is a method by which Web pages can store information inside your Web browser. Similar to cookies, this stored information exists even when you close a browser tab, surf away from the current website, or close the main browser. But unlike cookies, this data is not carried to the remote Web server unless sent explicitly by the web page. Local storage is often used to remember choices a user has made inside a Web application or to cache information to improve performance. Elements stored in browser Local storage are covered by this policy to the extent that the information stored in these elements is communicated back to the server.</p>
    <h3>3. Managing cookies and local storage</h3>
    <p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies and to delete cookies. If you block cookies, you may not be able to use all the features on our website, or have a worse experience. We have gathered information about how you can block and delete cookies and local storage elements. See the links for specific browser instructions:</p>

        <td>Advertising</td>

We may also work with advertising partners to show you an ad off PranaGEO.com services, after you've visited our site or application.</td>

    <h3>5. Integrations</h3>
    <p>We may make available integrations to other web-based services, allowing you to open those services inside PranaGEO. In order to use third-party integrations in this category, it may be necessary for you to enable support for third-party cookies in your browser. The reason for this is that such integrations may depend on cookies to assert your identity and/or authenticate your access to any non-public assets (documents, boards, etc) opened through them.</p>
